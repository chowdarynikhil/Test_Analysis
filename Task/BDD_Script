
// As per my understanding , the expected  Resource feature file for the before coded scenario .

1) Create project structure 

@FindBy(how=How.id , using ="lst-ib")
public static WebElement searchengine;

@FindBy(how=How.xpath , using ="//div[@class='sbqs_c']")
public static WebElement AllLinks;


2)Create under test/resources feature file


Feature: Google Searching  (it specifies module name)

  Scenario: The total number of results that google brings back (it specifies condition)
    Given   A web browser is at the Google home page     (it specifies pre-condition)
    When    The user enters "Test Automation" into the search bar (it specifies data for condition)
    Then    Auto suggestion list related to "Test Automation" are shown (it specifies expected outcome)
    Then    Count related to "Test Automation" are shown on the results page 
    And     List related to "Test Automation" are shown on the result page

 

3) Create BDD testing runner class:

Each line of the Gherkin scenario maps to a method in a step_Defination class

Copy the glue code from console and paste it in step_Defination class

4) Step definitions of our testing tool:
